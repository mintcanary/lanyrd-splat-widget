== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When I make changes on Lanyrd they don't show =

Lanyrd have a 10 minute cache for this info (at the time of writing)... please be patient

= Why does the widget call Lanyrd everytime? = 

Yes, we know this isn't the best but I think their API is still under development. Once this is available (or I've done more research) I'll use it and cache the results on the WordPress install.
